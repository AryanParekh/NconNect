ABOUT:-
This site is about connecting the NGOs with people willing to donate mainly with respect to the medical requirements during COVID. 

WORKING:-
The NGOs create an account where they upload their certain details including certificate of registration, official registration number, description and an image then their details are sent to an admin for verification. The NGOs upload their requirements and it’s quanity which is dynamically updated when a user donates a number of items and can be seen in the list of requirements view of NGO as well as user. However, the NGO’s name and it’s requirements are visible to the user only if it’s verified by the admin. 

The users create an account or login to their existing account. After logging in they can see their profile. In the NGOs tab they have a list of verified NGOs to choose from, on clicking on an NGO they can see the NGO’s description, image and list of requirements and choose the quantity of the particular item they want to donate. On submitting the quantity they get message that the NGOs shall contact them as of now we are considering on donations in kind.

The admin can view the list of NGOs and users. He keeps a check on NGOs and has an authority to validate or delete an NGO from the record.

The landing page also called the home page, has an opening image with donate button. Then it has an About Us section with hover animation, Why the user should donate section with little description about it and a rotating image gallery and a how the user can donate section which has basic 3 steps finally there is a contact section with details of the admin or the customer care part of the office.
